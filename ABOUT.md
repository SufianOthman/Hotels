# Why I picked .net!

For the last couple of years i have been working on .Net projects, Therefore it reduced the time for me to complete this task.  <p>First I built it on Framework 4.5 after completing the task I had to switch It to .net core 2 a new cross-platform provided by Microsoft so it can be associated with Heroku</p>

<p>Applied MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture which offers the advantage of organized code because of its Separation of Concerns methodology. </p>

# What I wanted to accomplish with this application !

Creating a POC for consuming an API, while keeping the code simple and maintainable. 
Keeping the Search Criteria side by side with the results on the same page for a better user experience.
<p>Details section with a map per hotel in the search results section to give the user an idea of the location</p>

# What I learned !
Had the chance to learn about Heroku and to get familiar with .net core.
